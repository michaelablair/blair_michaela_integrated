                    <!-- COLUMN 1 -->
                    Welcome! My name is Michaela Blair, and I am a 20 year old photographer from Ontario, Canada. I have always been interested in photos, especially detail shots of nature, but in the last few years this interest has grown into a passion.
                    <br><br>
                    While most of my work thus far has been of nature and whatever surroundings I find myself to be in at the time, I have also dabbled in family portraits and pet photos. I have a preference for colour, but I am also drawn to the contrast of black and white.

                    <!-- COLUMN 2 -->
                    Outside of photography, I am looking to pursue an education in theatre, specifically the technical production aspects. Don't expect to catch me in the spotlight, however, I'm very interested in being the person behind it!
                    <br><br>
                    I hope to use what I'll learn about lighting and production in that course in my future photo projects as well. I've always found the visuals of the theatre fascinating and beautiful, so capturing that in our images would be a dream.

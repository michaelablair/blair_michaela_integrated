# Blue Rose Photography

Website for a photography website. Includes a homepage, sessions page, and a gallery. Each page contains a contact page, with a form.

Each page contains a header and a footer with a navigation bar and a logo, as well as a contact section at the bottom with a form.

In the homepage, there is a business overview, and an about the photographer section.

In the photo session page, there is an overview of packages and equipment, and an interactive Google Calendar.

In the gallery page, there is a display of photos to show off work.

## Issues to Fix
